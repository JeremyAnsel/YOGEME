The LST Editor is used for XvT and XWA to make inserting your custom missions into the games easier.  The right side gives you simple example text as an example for the layout of the file, simply insert your filename with a brief description and you'll have easy access to the mission.<br><br>
You can replace the existing entries and wipe everything else out so only the custom missions are available, or you can add your missions to the end, so long as you're not overwriting mission numbers. It's up to you.
