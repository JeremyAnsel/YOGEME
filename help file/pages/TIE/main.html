There are three version of TIE Fighter; the original DOS on floppies, the original CD version and the Windows 95 Collector's edition which uses the Xwing vs TIE Fighter flight engine.  TIE95 is the most popular and the most likely version you'll run across, so that's what YOGEME is designed to handle.  There are differences between the versions, so something that works on one may not work on another.<br><br>
Being the first main platform (I don't count X-wing, let's call that their trial game) TIE95 is used as a base for the other three games. As such if you know how to edit TIE you'll have a good grasp on XvT/BoP and XWA. This help file is written with the assumption that TIE is being used first. Differences in the platforms will be the emphasis of the XvT and XWA sections, while similarities or common values will not get as much attention as they do here in TIE. I'm biased, get over it ;)<br><br>
