The Hyperbuoy dialog is used for XWA to make matching buoy pairs easier.  The left side initially shows all hyperbuoys that exist upon launch. As buoys are generated, they will also be added to this list.  What is shown is the bouy's FlightGroup Name, followed by the region numbers (one-indexed) it's connecting and how (to/from). Hitting 'Generate' will also add the buoys to the craft list in the main window. If the buoy generation would exceed mission craft limits, it will generate an error and no action will be taken.<br><br>
By default, only the initial pair indicated by the dropdowns will be created per the text below them. If the checkbox is checked, then a return pair will be created with the regions switched and slightly different arrival conditions.<br><br>
The buoy's waypoints will need to be set from the Flightgroup tab or Map. If there are additional Arrival conditions they will also need to be set back in the FlightGroup tab.
