X-wing Alliance, unfortunately likely the last Star Wars space sim we'll ever see.  XWA just about triples the number of ships in the game, both in the number of types as well as the number of ships in-game in one place.  It also gave us hyperspace capability, creating four separate regions of space to wander between.  Additional mission controls provide a means to make the missions almost dynamic with the ability to change IFFs in-game, cancel messages, jump to any order, and use different flight paths for different orders.<br><br>
XWA also further advanced multiplayer and even gave us the aiblity to animate the briefings for the first time. This is by far the most advanced of the platforms, and graphically the best looking.  There's still projects alive today to produce higher detail models to take advantage of modern computers. After working with XWA, you'll feel pretty constricted if you go back to TIE.<br><br>
