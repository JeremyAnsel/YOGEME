The Team tab sets the team names, allegiance and end of mission messages.  The selected team for the Team and Globals tabs are linked.<br><br>
Not much to explain here.  XWA adds a "Neutral" allegiance, which previously was a combination of the other two.  The extra text box is a note field, used as the name of the person speaking.<br><br>
The Name is limited to 17 char, EoM Messages to 64 char and the VoiceID to 20 char.<br><br>
There's some Unknown values that you can play with as well here.<br>
