Xwing v TIE and its expansion Balance of Power came about and brought the engine forward a few years.  A lot of the concourse and engine remained the same, however XvT brought multiplayer capability, a few more ships and better mission design controls.<br><br>
Sequentially, the change from TIE to XvT is not that bad, however XvT allows for much more depth and precision which XWA later advances further.<br><br>
Use the ToC on the left to navigate and start making missions.<br>
